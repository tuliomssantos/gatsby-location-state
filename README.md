With Gatsby, you can preserve the state between linked components through navigation.

With this simple technique it is possible to create rich environments and still guarantee optimum performance for search engines.

For example, you can create ecommerce linked products, ensure that each one has its own unique url and still allow the user to have a customized experience.
